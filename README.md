# Student-Course-Registration
Design and develop a java based registration system  to store and manage student details. Implemented  array object oriented concepts to streamline data handling reducing manual errors in student record management 
# 🎓 Student Course Registration System (Java)

## 📌 Overview
The **Student Course Registration System** is a simple console-based Java application that allows users to register students with their **ID, Name, and Course**, and then view the list of all registered students.  

This project demonstrates fundamental **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Java, such as:
- **Classes & Objects**
- **Constructors**
- **Methods**
- **Arrays for data storage**
- **User input handling with Scanner**

It’s designed as a beginner-friendly project for understanding how to structure small Java applications.
